# Phenome-wide association study of the major histocompatibility complex region in the Korean population identifies novel association signals (Kim et al., 2022)


## Abstract

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene variants in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region are associated with numerous complex human diseases and quantitative traits. Previous phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) for this region demonstrated that HLA association patterns to the phenome have both population-specific and population-shared components. We performed MHC PheWAS in the Korean population by analyzing associations between phenotypes and genetic variants in the MHC region using the Korea Biobank Array project data samples from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study cohorts. Using this single-population dataset, we curated and analyzed 82 phenotypes for 125â€‰673 Korean individuals after imputing HLA using CookHLA, a recently developed imputation framework. More than one-third of these phenotypes showed significant associations, confirming 56 known associations and discovering 13 novel association signals that were not reported previously. In addition, we analyzed heritability explained by the variants in the MHC region and genetic correlations among phenotypes based on the MHC variants.
